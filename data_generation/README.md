# Concrete Cracking Data Generation
Generates cracking patterns and indication of surface cracking based of inputted corrosion patterns.

The crack pattern is generated by first randomly choosing a concrete cover thickness, a rebar size, a concrete mix design (water-to-cement ratio), and a tensile strength of the concrete. Then the geometry of the reinforced concrete is meshed. From there, a coupled lattice-FEM is used to determine the crack pattern and the process is terminated once cracking reaches the surface.

# Usage
```
matlab -nodesktop -r generateCrackData.m
```

#Outputs
- rebar: radius of the reinforcement (m)
- cover: amount of concrete covering the reinforcement (m)
- tensile_strength: tensile strength of the concrete (mpa)
- w_c: water-to-cement ratio, indicator of mix design of concrete
- ind: indicator of whether cracking reached the surface
- exp_corr_layer: vector of the corrosion pattern
